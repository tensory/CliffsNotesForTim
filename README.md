Cliff's Notes for Biology Computing
=================

++ Data analysis ++

+++ R +++
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)

This is a statistical package with many built-in data analysis and graphing functions. If you're considering making a chart of anything, try R.

++ Programming ++

+++ The Python language +++
http://www.python.org/

This language has replaced Perl in many areas of current scientific work. It's just a general scripting language.

If you start down the road of learning Python by building projects, I recommend starting right away using Python virtual environments. Use a new environment for each project.

http://newcoder.io/Setup-your-machine/ has the best guide to that. This will also start you off with software version control using Git.

+++ NumPy +++
http://www.numpy.org/

NumPy is a module for Python that makes it easy to load data into memory as a 2D array and then do all sorts of math to it. Between using R and using Python with NumPy it would just depend on what your collaborators want to use and what type of file your data is coming in. 

You can install NumPy as a module in a specific Python virtual environment, or install it to the system's base Python. It's a rather large library with a lot of dependencies.

+++ Matplotlib +++
http://matplotlib.org/

Another Python module. Make prettier pictures with Python than you get from R.

+++ iPython Notebook +++
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/notebook.html

This just came out six months ago. It is really awesome. Before, when using Python, you either had to write a finished script and give it run permissions and run it in a file, or work on a frustrating command-line environment. iPython Notebook launches from the command line but opens up a web browser where you can play around and write scripts one chunk at a time. It lets you save all your experiments and generate graphs in the browser. 


++ Books ++

"Data Analysis with Open Source Tools", by Philipp K. Janert. This book assumes knowledge of basic Python.

You could buy this book, orrrrrrr... http://it-ebooks.info/book/624/

"Elementary Statistics" by Neil Weiss.
Or many books like it. Just, you know: gotta have it!

"Introduction to Differential Equations" by William Boyce.
Or many books like it. I have the Boyce text and it works for me. Take diffeqs after you take differentiation and integration calculus.
